If the specified key is not already associated with a value or is associated
with null, associates it with the given non-null value. Otherwise, replaces the
associated value with the results of the given remapping function, or removes
if the result is null. This method may be of use when combining multiple mapped
values for a key. For example, to either create or append a String msg to a
value mapping.
